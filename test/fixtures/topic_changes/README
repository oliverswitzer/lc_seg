Quality: These should be considered 'reference segmentations' and
 are based on segmentations from at least three judges.

The format of the original files is simple as are my translations. See
the reference above and Michel Galley's own README which is appended at
the end of this file.


Using this data in NXT
----------------------

To use hotspot data alone, copy the XML files from this directory into
your main ICSI meeting data directory. Then add this to the
'interaction-codings' section of your metadata file (normally called
ICSI-metadata.xml):

            <!-- topic codings from Michel Galley et al. -->
            <coding-file name="tops">
                <time-aligned-layer name="galley-topic-layer">
                    <code name="top">
                        <attribute name="type" value-type="enumerated">
                            <value>digits</value>
                            <value>cut</value>
                            <value>agenda</value>
                        </attribute>
                    </code>
                </time-aligned-layer>
            </coding-file>

You will find that applications now load this data and the topic
segmentation can be loaded.

Introduction

   This archive contains an annotation of the stucture of 25 meetings
   taken from the ICSI Meeting corpus.

Corpus Description

   Each meeting transcription was segmented by at least three judges.
   For their annotation, we built a reference segmentation (the procedure
   is described in the next section). It consists of the following files:

       3 "even deeper understanding" meetings meetings:
       Bed003.ref  Bed004.ref  Bed011.ref

       19 "meeting recorder" meetings:
       Bmr001.ref  Bmr002.ref  Bmr005.ref  Bmr007.ref  Bmr008.ref  
       Bmr009.ref  Bmr010.ref  Bmr011.ref  Bmr012.ref  Bmr013.ref  
       Bmr014.ref  Bmr018.ref  Bmr021.ref  Bmr022.ref  Bmr024.ref  
       Bmr025.ref  Bmr026.ref  Bmr027.ref  Bmr029.ref

       3 "robustness" meetings:
       Bro004.ref  Bro007.ref  Bro015.ref

   In these files, each line corresponds to a segment, charterized by a 
   start time and, optionally, by a tag representing special segments.
   The optional tag is one of the following:

   - cut    : pre-meeting chatting. This speech that isn't really part of
              the meeting. 
   - agenda : the agenda of the meeting is either decided or repeated.
   - digits : digits are recorded.

   There is no gap between segments, so the end time of a segment is
   determined by the start time of the following one (for the last 
   segment, by the end time of the meeting).

Reference Segmentation

   We had to be careful in order to determine a reference segmentation based
   on the segmentation of the 3+ jduges. The main issue is that annotators
   rarely mark boundaries at the exact same position. Our idea was the
   following: two boundaries found by two different annotators are considered
   equivalent if they are separated by no more than 20 seconds (the
   motivation for this is that the movement from one topic to the next is
   generally not "clear-cut".) For each set of equivalent boundaries, we
   determine if there is majority opinion (i.e. if they out number the number
   of annotators who didn't find any boundary in the region). If there is a
   majority, we add one of the boundaries to the reference segmentation (the
   one that is closest to mean time). We had two judges to take a decision in
   difficult cases (e.g. when a set of boudnaries spans more than 20 seconds.)
